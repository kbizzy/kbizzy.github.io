So I was doing really well with keeping up on my studying.  Working a couple hours everyday but then we went on a 10 day vacation which followed shortly with both my kids getting extremely sick.  I am finally able to jump back into my work and hopefully get a move on what i'm learning.

After spending some time reviewing my notes (I hope I haven't forgotten everything I learned previously) it has been a struggle to really get back into it.  I do find that I really enjoy learning about Ruby and the structure of the classes have really been helpful.  Hopefully my enthusiasm and motivation will kick in and I will be able to flow through this introduction and move into HTML and CSS quickly and easily.
