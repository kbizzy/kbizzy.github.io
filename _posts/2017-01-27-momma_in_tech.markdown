  Let me start by saying that I would never consider myself a blogger.  I really don't think I have the wit nor the aptitude to construct a heartfelt and interesting blog post on any given topic.  However, I also think this challenge of writing 7 blog posts for school will help me find a new passion for writing and maybe even improve my grammer skills.
	
  So how did I become interested in software development? Jump back to 13 years ago I had just graduated Undergrad with a degree in Media Computing.  I had no idea what to do! (I spent 4 years teaching myself all the required programs because it was a brand spanking new major with little to no experienced professors.)  I decided I wasn't ready to stop learning and ended up applying for a two year Masters program for teaching. 8+ years later I had taught at two different schools and realized I was was done being a pin cushion. 
	
	I started taking free coding tutorials online and soon realized that I really enjoyed learning code.  I began to research what other options were out there and found that there a plethura of bootcamps and tutorials to choose from.  My search for the right program for me would take two years, convincing my husband that it was worth it and trying to figure out the best program for my learning style.
	
	I'm looking forward to begining my journey in the tech world and hopefully by the end of this program excel in many areas I never thought possible.
