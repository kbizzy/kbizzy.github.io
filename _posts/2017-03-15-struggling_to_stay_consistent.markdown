I am so far behind from when I first started this course.  I really enjoy learning new things but when you have a husband who works basically 24/7 and two little ones to take care of finding time to sit down consistently is a struggle.  

When I first began the program I was able to study daily for 2-3 hours.  After a planned vacation and sick kids I have struggled to find time and basically stay awake.  I don't think I've slept 2 hours straight in 2 months!! I'm exhausted and now itâ€™s affecting my ability to remember the things I've learned.  I take notes on everything to reinforce the skills but it doesn't seem to help.

I really hope I become more consistent and less frustrated with each lesson.  It is getting harder and I'm becoming more frustrated as I go.  My goals the rest of the month is to at least get a minimum of an hour a day to stay consistent and help alleviate my frustrations.
